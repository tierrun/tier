# Pricing as Code

`tier` is a tool that lets you define and manage your SaaS application's pricing model in one place (pricing.json). 

Tier will handle setting up and managing Stripe in a way that is much more friendly for SaaS and consumption based billing models. Tier's SDK can then be implemented for access checking, metering/reporting, and more.
